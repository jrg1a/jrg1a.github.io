## JÃ¸rgen Austnes

I am a Cyber Engineering student with a B.Sc in Computer Science, specializing in Cybersecurity. I currently reside in the rainy city of Bergen, Norway, where I study at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences.

### About Me
I have a deep passion for technology and security, always eager to take on new challenges and explore innovative projects. My current studies focus on the intersection of computer science and electrical engineering, with a particular interest in IoT, embedded systems, and networking.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am actively working towards earning my CCNA certification while expanding my knowledge of cybersecurity and network automation. My skillset includes programming in Python, C++, Java, C#, and MATLAB, as well as hands-on experience with microcontrollers, routers, and switches. I am comfortable working across different operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Outside of academics, I enjoy participating in CTF challenges, which allow me to sharpen my skills in cybersecurity and problem-solving. As the First Vice Chair of the Central Board in NITO Studentene, I dedicate my time to leadership and volunteer work, helping to support fellow students and promote professional development opportunities.
Areas of Interest. 

In addition to my studies and volunteer work, I am also a member of the Program Committee for the Cybersecurity Professional Network in NITO. In this role, I collaborate with industry professionals and security experts to plan and organize events, courses, and initiatives that strengthen the knowledge and community within the field of cybersecurity

### My areas of interest include:
