Im a Cyber-Physical Engineering student with a B.Sc in Computer Science with focus on Cyber Security. I currently recide in the rainy city of Bergen, Norway.
I have a passion for technology and security, and I am always looking for new challenges and projects to work on. Besides my studies, im working towards getting my CCNA certification and learning more about the world of Cyber Security. My studies focus on the intersection between computer science and electrical engineering, and I have a particular interest in the field of IoT and embedded systems, and networks. 

My current studies consists of courses with a focus on mathemathics, physics, electrical and electronics, software, and network engineering. I have experience with programming in Python, C++, Java, and C#, and I have experience with working with microcontrollers, routers, and switches. I have experience with working with different operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, and MacOS, and I have experience with working with different network protocols and technologies, and configuring and setting up networks.

I am interested in learning more about Cyber Security, Network Automation, Cloud Technology and IoT. In my free time, I like to work on CTF-challenges, train, read, and volunteer work in NITO Studentene, as the First Vice Chair of the Central Board.
